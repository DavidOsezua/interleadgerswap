            aware of these changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            5.3. For normal orders, the exchange rate you receive is calculated
            at the time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security
            between blockchain, your payment is typically considered “accepted”
            at six blocks confirmation. It is important to note that a payment
            being broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an
            acceptance by ChangeNOW of that payment.

          <p>
            5.4. The ChangeNOW’s interest (the ChangeNOW’s remuneration for the

            6.1. Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets are, by their nature,
            generally irreversible, and their exchange rates are highly volatile
            and transitory. We cannot be responsible for any risk in use of the
            Website, including but not limited to exchange rate risk and market

            User’s side of the transaction, the “Order Status” page on the

            in a refund of the User’s deposited Digital Asset or the outgoing
            Digital Asset to which the User was exchanging.
